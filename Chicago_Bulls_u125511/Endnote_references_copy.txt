                  statistic that is derived from basic individual statistics:
                  points, rebounds, assists, steals, blocks, turnovers and shot
                  attempts. The efficiency stat, in theory, accounts for both a
                  player's offensive contributions (points, assists) and their
                  defensive contributions (steals, blocks), but it is generally
                  thought that efficiency ratings favor offense-oriented
                  players over those who specialize in defense, as defense is
                  difficult to quantify with currently tabulated statistics.",
